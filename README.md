1. It's key (type: String) is a day: [Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun].
2. Corresponding value (type: Int) is the sum of all values on that particular day.
3. Also, if dictionary D doesn't have a particular day, then 'ans' dictionary will have the value of that day as the mean of previous and the next day.
4. Assume Mon and Sun always exists in D.
